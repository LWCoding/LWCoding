- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LWCoding! I'm a college student attending Stanford University majoring in CS and Design.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in the interdisciplinary nature of art in computer science. I look forward to working with all kinds of mediums with the sole purpose of creating.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning so many things. From developing games in Unity, to designing websites in React, to drawing digital artwork, to music composition, to project management, to story writing. I embrace everything when it comes to design and development.
