- 👋 Hi, I’m @LWCoding! I'm a high school student living in a small apartment in Illinois.
- 👀 I'm interested in the interdisciplinary nature of art in computer science. I love designing *new* things and don't limit myself to large-scale "professional" projects. Whether it's a small meaningless project that's purely done for personal enjoyment, or one that may end up replacing something large in society, I look forward to working with all kinds of mediums with the sole purpose of creating.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning so many things. From programming in Unity, to programming in React, to drawing digital artwork, to music composition, to project management, to story writing and development. I embrace *everything* when it comes to design and development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything. Just shoot me a private message! I'd be willing to help develop a pre-existing project, unfamiliar or not. I'm always willing to learn something new - even if it's something as foreign to me as a new cryptocurrency.
- 📫 How to reach me? My personal email is lwangprivate@gmail.com.
